Available GPUs: 2
Instruct evaluation: False
The model name does not contain '.nemo'.
The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
	`--num_processes` was set to a value of `2`
		More than one GPU was found, enabling multi-GPU training.
		If this was unintended please pass in `--num_processes=1`.
	`--num_machines` was set to a value of `1`
	`--mixed_precision` was set to a value of `'no'`
	`--dynamo_backend` was set to a value of `'no'`
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.

ConnectionError: Tried to launch distributed communication on port `29500`, but another process is utilizing it. Please specify a different port (such as using the `--main_process_port` flag or specifying a different `main_process_port` in your config file) and rerun your script. To automatically use the next open port (on a single node), you can set this to `0`.
