# Docker Setup

## Purpose  
This branch of [lm-evaluation-harness]() is designed to build a *Docker* image of the framework, enabling parameterized evaluation of models in `IberoBench`. The `IberoBench` evaluation consists of four task groups:

- **spanish_bench**: Tasks in Spanish.  
- **catalan_bench**: Tasks in Catalan.  
- **galician_bench**: Tasks in Galician.  
- **basque_bench**: Tasks in Basque.  

This setup allows for streamlined and reproducible model evaluation across different linguistic benchmarks.
